Chapter Two <BRK> The policeman driving us to jail was Mr . Avery Gaston , <BRK> but the men at the Esso station called him Shoe . <BRK> A puzzling nickname since there was nothing remarkable about his shoes , <BRK> or even his feet so far as I could see . <BRK> The one thing about him was the smallness of his ears , <BRK> the ears of a child , ears like little dried apricots . <BRK> I fixed my eyes on them from the backseat and wondered why he wasn't called Ears . <BRK> The three men followed us in a green pickup with a gun rack inside . <BRK> They drove close to our bumper and blew the horn every few seconds . <BRK> I jumped each time , <BRK> and Rosaleen gave my leg a pat . <BRK> In front of the Western Auto the men started a game of pulling alongside us <BRK> and yelling things out the window , <BRK> mostly things we couldn't make out because our windows were rolled up . <BRK> People in the back of police cars <BRK> were not given the benefit of door handles or window cranks , I noticed , <BRK> so we were blessed to be chauffeured to jail in smothering heat , <BRK> watching the men mouth things we were glad not to know . <BRK> Rosaleen looked straight ahead <BRK> and acted as if the men were insignificant houseflies buzzing at our screen door . <BRK> I was the only one who could feel the way her thighs trembled , the whole backseat like a vibrating bed . <BRK> Mr . Gaston , <BRK> I said , <BRK> those men aren't coming with us , are they ? <BRK> His smile appeared in the rearview mirror . <BRK> I can't say what men riled up like that will do . <BRK> Before Main Street they tired of the amusement and sped off . <BRK> I breathed easier , <BRK> but when we pulled into the empty lot behind the police station , they were waiting on the back steps . <BRK> The dealer tapped a flashlight against the palm of his hand . <BRK> The other two held our church fans , <BRK> waving them back and forth . <BRK> When we got out of the car , <BRK> Mr . Gaston put handcuffs on Rosaleen , <BRK> fastening her arms behind her back . <BRK> I walked so close to her <BRK> I felt heat vapor trailing off her skin . <BRK> She stopped ten yards short of the men and refused to budge . <BRK> Now , look here , <BRK> don't make me get out my gun , <BRK> Mr . Gaston said . <BRK> Usually the only time the police in Sylvan got to use their guns <BRK> was when they got called out to shoot rattlesnakes in people's yards . <BRK> Come on , Rosaleen , <BRK> I said . <BRK> What can they do to you with a policeman right here ? <BRK> That was when the dealer lifted the flashlight over his head , <BRK> then down , <BRK> smashing it into Rosaleen's forehead . <BRK> She dropped to her knees . <BRK> I don't remember screaming , <BRK> but the next thing I knew , Mr . Gaston had his hand clamped over my mouth . <BRK> Hush , <BRK> he said . <BRK> Maybe now you feel like apologizing , <BRK> the dealer said . <BRK> Rosaleen tried to get to her feet , <BRK> but without her hands it was hopeless . <BRK> It took me and Mr . Gaston both to pull her up . <BRK> Your black ass is gonna apologize one way or another , <BRK> the dealer said , <BRK> and he stepped toward Rosaleen . <BRK> Hold on now , Franklin , <BRK> said Mr . Gaston , moving us toward the door . <BRK> Now's not the time . <BRK> I'm not resting till she apologizes . <BRK> That's the last I heard him yell before we got inside , <BRK> where I had an overpowering impulse to kneel down and kiss the jailhouse floor . <BRK> The only image I had for jails was from westerns at the movies , <BRK> and this one was nothing like that . <BRK> For one thing , it was painted pink and had flower print curtains in the window . <BRK> It turned out we'd come in through the jailer's living quarters . <BRK> His wife stepped in from the kitchen , greasing a muffin tin . <BRK> Got you two more mouths to feed , <BRK> Mr . Gaston said , <BRK> and she went back to work without a smile of sympathy . <BRK> He led us around to the front , <BRK> where there were two rows of jail cells , <BRK> all of them empty . <BRK> Mr . Gaston removed Rosaleen's handcuffs and handed her a towel from the bathroom . <BRK> She pressed it against her head while he filled out papers at a desk , <BRK> followed by a period of poking around for keys in a file drawer . <BRK> The jail cells smelled with the breath of drunk people . <BRK> He put us in the first cell on the first row , <BRK> where somebody <BRK> had scratched the words Shit Throne across a bench attached to one wall . <BRK> Nothing seemed quite real . <BRK> We're in jail , <BRK> I thought . <BRK> We're in jail . <BRK> When Rosaleen pulled back the towel , <BRK> I saw an inch long gash across a puffy place high over her eyebrow . <BRK> Is it hurting bad ? <BRK> I asked . <BRK> Some , <BRK> she said . <BRK> She circled the cell two or three times before sinking down onto the bench . <BRK> T . Ray will get us out , <BRK> I said . <BRK> Uh huh . <BRK> She didn't speak another word till Mr . Gaston opened the cell door about a half hour later . <BRK> Come on , <BRK> he said . <BRK> Rosaleen looked hopeful for a moment . <BRK> She actually started to lift herself up . <BRK> He shook his head . <BRK> You ain't going anywhere . <BRK> Just the girl . <BRK> At the door I held on to a cell bar like it was the long bone in Rosaleen's arm . <BRK> I'll be back . <BRK> All right ? All right , Rosaleen ? <BRK> You go on , <BRK> I'll manage . <BRK> The caved in look of her face <BRK> nearly did me in . <BRK> The speedometer needle on T . Ray's truck wiggled so badly I couldn't make out whether it pointed <BRK> to seventy or eighty . <BRK> Leaning into the steering wheel , <BRK> he jammed his foot onto the accelerator , <BRK> let off , <BRK> then jammed it again . <BRK> The poor truck was rattling to the point I expected the hood to fly off and decapitate a couple of pine trees . <BRK> I imagined that T . Ray was rushing home so he could start right away constructing pyramids of grits all <BRK> through the house a <BRK> torture chamber of food staples , <BRK> where I would go from one pile to the next , <BRK> kneeling for hours on end with nothing but bathroom breaks . <BRK> I didn't care . <BRK> I couldn't think of anything but Rosaleen back there in jail . <BRK> I squinted at him sideways . <BRK> What about Rosaleen ? <BRK> You have to get her out <BRK> You're lucky I got you out ! <BRK> he yelled . <BRK> But she can't stay there <BRK> She dumped snuff juice on three white men ! <BRK> What the hell was she thinking ? <BRK> And on Franklin Posey , for Christ's sake . <BRK> She couldn't pick somebody normal ? <BRK> He's the meanest nigger hater in Sylvan . <BRK> He'd as soon kill her as look at her . <BRK> But not really , <BRK> I said . <BRK> You don't mean he would really kill her . <BRK> What I mean is , I wouldn't be surprised if he flat out killed her . <BRK> My arms felt weak in their sockets . <BRK> Franklin Posey was the man with the flashlight , <BRK> and he was gonna kill Rosaleen . <BRK> But then , hadn't I known this inside even before T . Ray ever said it ? <BRK> He followed me up the stairs . <BRK> I moved with deliberate slowness , <BRK> anger suddenly building in me . <BRK> How could he leave Rosaleen in jail like that ? <BRK> As I stepped inside my room , <BRK> he stopped at the doorway . <BRK> I have to go settle the payroll for the pickers , <BRK> he said . <BRK> Don't you leave this room . <BRK> You understand me ? You sit here and think about me coming back and dealing with you . <BRK> Think about it real hard . <BRK> You don't scare me , <BRK> I said , <BRK> mostly under my breath . <BRK> He'd already turned to leave , <BRK> but now he whirled back . <BRK> What did you say ? <BRK> You don't scare me , <BRK> I repeated , <BRK> louder this time . <BRK> A brazen feeling had broken loose in me , <BRK> a daring something that had been locked up in my chest . <BRK> He stepped toward me , <BRK> raising the back of his hand like he might bring it down across my face . <BRK> You better watch your mouth . <BRK> Go ahead , <BRK> try and hit me ! <BRK> I yelled . <BRK> When he swung , <BRK> I turned my face . <BRK> It was a clean miss . <BRK> I ran for the bed and scrambled onto the middle of it , breathing hard . My mother will never let you touch me again ! <BRK> I shouted . <BRK> Your mother ? <BRK> His face was bright red . <BRK> You think that goddamn woman gave a shit about you ? <BRK> My mother loved me ! <BRK> I cried . <BRK> He threw back his head and let out a forced , bitter laugh . <BRK> It's <BRK> it's not funny , <BRK> I said . <BRK> He lunged toward the bed then , pressing his fists into the mattress , <BRK> bringing his face so close <BRK> I could see the tiny holes where his whiskers grew . I slid backward , <BRK> toward the pillows , shoving my back into the headboard . <BRK> Not funny ? <BRK> he yelled . <BRK> Not funny ? <BRK> Why , it's the funniest goddamn thing I ever heard <BRK> you thinking your mother is your guardian angel . <BRK> He laughed again . <BRK> The woman could have cared less about you . <BRK> That's not true , <BRK> I said . It's not . <BRK> And how would you know ? <BRK> he said , still leaning toward me . A leftover smile pulled the corners of his mouth . <BRK> I hate you ! <BRK> I screamed . <BRK> That stopped his smiling instantly . <BRK> He stiffened . <BRK> Why , you little bitch , <BRK> he said . <BRK> The color faded from his lips . <BRK> Suddenly I felt ice cold , <BRK> as if something dangerous had slipped into the room . <BRK> I looked toward the window and felt a tremor slide along my spine . <BRK> You listen to me , <BRK> he said , <BRK> his voice deadly calm . <BRK> The truth is , <BRK> your sorry mother ran off and left you . <BRK> The day she died , <BRK> she'd come back to get her things , that's all . <BRK> You can hate me all you want , <BRK> but she's the one who left you . <BRK> The room turned absolutely silent . <BRK> He brushed at something on his shirtfront , <BRK> then walked to the door . <BRK> After he left , <BRK> I didn't move except to trace the bars of light on the bed with my finger . <BRK> The sound of his boots banging down the stairs drifted away , <BRK> and I took the pillows from underneath the bedspread <BRK> and placed them around me like <BRK> I was making an inner tube that might keep me afloat . I could understand her leaving him . <BRK> But leaving me ? <BRK> This would sink me forever . <BRK> The bee jar sat on the bedside table , <BRK> empty now . <BRK> Sometime since this morning the <BRK> bees had finally gotten around to flying off . <BRK> I reached over <BRK> and took the jar in my hands , and out came the tears I'd been holding on to , <BRK> it seemed like for years . <BRK> Your sorry mother ran off and left you . <BRK> The day she died , <BRK> she'd come back to get her things , <BRK> that's all . <BRK> God and Jesus , <BRK> you make him take it back . <BRK> The memory settled over me . <BRK> The suitcase on the floor . <BRK> The way they'd fought . <BRK> My shoulders began to shake in a strange , uncontrollable way . <BRK> I held the jar pressed between my breasts , <BRK> hoping it would steady me , <BRK> but I <BRK> couldn't stop shaking , couldn't stop crying , <BRK> and it frightened me , <BRK> as though I'd been struck by a car I hadn't seen coming and was lying on the side of the road , trying to understand <BRK> what had happened . <BRK> I sat on the edge of the bed , <BRK> replaying his words over and over . <BRK> Each time there was a wrench in what felt like my heart . <BRK> I don't know how long I sat there feeling broken to pieces . <BRK> Finally I walked to <BRK> the window and gazed out at the peach trees stretching halfway to North Carolina , the way they held up their leafy arms in gestures of pure beseeching . <BRK> The rest was sky and air and lonely space . <BRK> I looked down at the bee jar still clutched in my hand <BRK> and saw a teaspoon of teardrops floating in the bottom . <BRK> I unfastened the window screen and poured it out . <BRK> The wind lifted it on her skirt tails <BRK> and shook it over the blistered grass . <BRK> How could she have left me ? <BRK> I stood there several minutes looking out on the world , <BRK> trying to understand . <BRK> Little birds were singing , so perfect . <BRK> That's when it came to me <BRK> What if my mother leaving wasn't true ? <BRK> What if T . Ray had made it up to punish me ? <BRK> I felt almost dizzy with relief . <BRK> That was it . <BRK> That had to be it . <BRK> I mean , my father was <BRK> Thomas Edison when it came to inventing punishments . <BRK> Once after I'd back talked him , <BRK> he'd told me my rabbit , <BRK> Mademoiselle , <BRK> had died , <BRK> and I'd cried all night <BRK> before I discovered her the next morning healthy as anything in her pen . <BRK> He had to be making this up , too . <BRK> Some things were not possible in this world . <BRK> Children did not have two parents who refused to love them . <BRK> One , maybe , <BRK> but for pity's sake , not two . It had to be like he'd said before <BRK> she was cleaning out the closet the day of the accident . <BRK> People cleaned out closets all the time . <BRK> I took a breath to steady myself . <BRK> You could say I'd never had a true religious moment , <BRK> the kind where you know yourself <BRK> spoken to by a voice that seems other than yourself , spoken to so genuinely you <BRK> see the words shining on trees and clouds . <BRK> But I had such a moment right then , <BRK> standing in my own ordinary room . <BRK> I heard a voice say , <BRK> Lily Melissa Owens , <BRK> your jar is open . <BRK> In a matter of seconds I knew exactly what I had to do leave . <BRK> I had to get away from T . Ray , <BRK> who was probably on his way back this minute to do Lord knows what to me . <BRK> Not to mention I had to get Rosaleen out of jail . <BRK> The clock read 2 40 . <BRK> I needed a solid plan , <BRK> but I didn't have <BRK> the luxury of sitting down to think one up . <BRK> I grabbed my pink canvas duffel bag , the one I'd planned to use for overnights the minute anyone asked me . I took the thirty eight dollars I'd earned selling peaches and stuffed it into the bag with my seven best pairs of panties , <BRK> the ones that had the days of the week printed across the backside . <BRK> I dumped in socks , <BRK> five pairs of shorts , tops , a nightgown , shampoo , brush , toothpaste , <BRK> toothbrush , <BRK> rubber bands for my hair , <BRK> all the time watching the window . <BRK> What else ? <BRK> Catching sight of the map tacked on the wall , I snatched it down , not bothering to pry out the tacks . I reached under the mattress <BRK> and pulled out my mother's picture , the gloves , <BRK> and the wooden picture of black Mary , and tucked them down in the bag , too . <BRK> Tearing a sheet of paper from last year's English notebook , <BRK> I wrote a note , <BRK> short and to the point <BRK> Dear T . Ray , <BRK> Don't bother looking for me . <BRK> Lily . <BRK> PS . <BRK> People who tell lies like you <BRK> should rot in hell . <BRK> When I checked the window , T <BRK> . Ray was coming out of the orchard toward the house , fists balled , <BRK> head plowed forward like a bull wanting to gore something . <BRK> I propped the note on my dresser and stood a moment in the center of the room , <BRK> wondering if I'd ever see it again . <BRK> Good bye , <BRK> I said , <BRK> and there was a tiny sprig of sadness pushing up from my heart . <BRK> Outside , <BRK> I spied the broken space in the latticework that wrapped around the foundation of the house . <BRK> Squeezing through , <BRK> I disappeared into violet light and cobwebbed air . <BRK> T . Ray's boots stomped across the porch . <BRK> Lily ! <BRK> Li leeeee ! <BRK> I heard his voice sailing along the floorboards of the house . <BRK> All of a sudden <BRK> I caught sight of Snout sniffing at the spot where I'd crawled through . I backed deeper into the darkness , <BRK> but she'd caught my scent and started barking her mangy head off . <BRK> T . Ray emerged with my note crumpled in his hand , <BRK> yelled at Snout to shut the hell up , <BRK> and tore out in his truck , <BRK> leaving plumes of exhaust all along the driveway . <BRK> Walking along the weedy strip beside the highway for the second time that day , <BRK> I was thinking how much older fourteen had made me . <BRK> In the space of a few hours I'd become forty years old . <BRK> The road stretched empty as far as I could see , <BRK> with heat shimmer making the air seem wavy in places . <BRK> If I managed to get Rosaleen free an <BRK> if so big it could have been the planet Jupiter just <BRK> where did I think we'd go ? <BRK> Suddenly I stood still . <BRK> Tiburon , South Carolina . <BRK> Of course . <BRK> The town written on the back of the black Mary picture . <BRK> Hadn't I been planning to go there one of these days ? <BRK> It made such perfect sense <BRK> my mother had been there . <BRK> Or else she knew people there who'd cared enough to send her a nice picture of Jesus' mother . <BRK> And who would ever think to look for us there ? <BRK> I squatted beside the ditch and unfolded the map . <BRK> Tiburon was a pencil dot beside the big red star of Columbia . <BRK> T . Ray would check the bus station , <BRK> so Rosaleen and I would have to hitchhike . <BRK> How hard could that be ? <BRK> You stand there with your thumb out and a person takes pity on you . <BRK> A short distance past the church , <BRK> Brother Gerald whizzed by in his white Ford . <BRK> I saw his brake lights flicker . <BRK> He backed up . <BRK> I thought that was you , <BRK> he said through the window . <BRK> Where're you headed ? <BRK> Town . <BRK> Again ? <BRK> What's the bag for ? <BRK> I'm I'm taking some things to Rosaleen . <BRK> She's in jail . <BRK> Yeah , I know , <BRK> he said , flinging open the passenger door . Get in , <BRK> I'm heading <BRK> there myself . <BRK> I'd never been inside a preacher's car before . <BRK> It's not that I expected a ton of Bibles stacked on the backseat , <BRK> but I was surprised to see that , <BRK> inside , <BRK> it was like anybody else's car . <BRK> You're going to see Rosaleen ? <BRK> I said . <BRK> The police called and asked me to press charges against her for stealing church property . <BRK> They say she took some of our fans . <BRK> You know anything about that ? <BRK> It was only two fans <BRK> He jumped straight into his pulpit voice . <BRK> In the eyes of God it doesn't matter whether it's two fans or two hundred . <BRK> Stealing <BRK> is stealing . <BRK> She asked if she could take the fans , <BRK> I said no , in plain English . <BRK> She took them anyway . <BRK> Now that's sin , Lily . <BRK> Pious people have always gotten on my nerves . <BRK> But she's deaf in one ear , <BRK> I said . <BRK> I think she just mixed up what you said . <BRK> She's always doing that . <BRK> T . Ray will tell her , <BRK> 'Iron my two shirts , <BRK> ' and she'll iron the blue shirts . <BRK> A hearing problem . <BRK> Well , I didn't know that , <BRK> he said . <BRK> Rosaleen would never steal a thing . <BRK> They said she'd assaulted some men at the Esso station . <BRK> It wasn't like that , <BRK> I said . <BRK> See , <BRK> she was singing her favorite hymn , <BRK> 'Were you there when they crucified my Lord ? ' <BRK> I don't believe those men are Christians , <BRK> Brother Gerald , <BRK> because they yelled at her to shut up with that blankety blank Jesus tune . <BRK> Rosaleen said , 'You can curse me , <BRK> but don't blaspheme the Lord Jesus . ' <BRK> But they kept right on . <BRK> So she poured the juice from her snuff cup on their shoes . <BRK> Maybe she was wrong , <BRK> but in her mind <BRK> she was standing up for Jesus . <BRK> I was sweating through my top and <BRK> all along the backs of my thighs . <BRK> Brother Gerald dragged his teeth back and forth across his lip . <BRK> I could tell he was actually weighing what I'd said . Chapter Six <BRK> The next morning , <BRK> inside the honey house , <BRK> I woke to banging in the yard . <BRK> When I pulled myself off the cot and wandered outside , <BRK> I found the tallest Negro man I'd ever seen working on the truck , <BRK> bent over the motor , <BRK> tools scattered around his feet . <BRK> June handed him wrenches and what have you , <BRK> cocking her head and beaming at him . <BRK> In the kitchen May and Rosaleen were working on pancake batter . <BRK> I didn't like pancakes that much , <BRK> but I didn't say so . I was just thankful it wasn't grits . <BRK> After kneeling on them half your life , <BRK> you don't care to eat them . <BRK> The trash can was full of banana peels , <BRK> and the electric percolator bubbled into the tiny glass nozzle on top of it . <BRK> Bloop , bloop . <BRK> I loved the way it sounded , the way it smelled . <BRK> Who's the man out there ? I asked . <BRK> That's Neil , <BRK> said May . <BRK> He's sweet on June . <BRK> It looks to me like June is sweet on him , too . <BRK> Yeah , <BRK> but she won't say so , <BRK> said May . <BRK> She's kept that poor man strung along for years . <BRK> Won't marry him and won't let him go . <BRK> May drizzled batter on the griddle in the shape of a big L . <BRK> This one's yours , <BRK> she said . <BRK> L for Lily . <BRK> Rosaleen set the table and warmed the honey in a bowl of hot water . <BRK> I poured orange juice into the jelly glasses . <BRK> How come June won't get married to him ? <BRK> I asked . <BRK> She was supposed to get married to somebody else a long time ago , <BRK> said May . <BRK> But he didn't show up for the wedding . <BRK> I looked at Rosaleen , <BRK> afraid this situation of jilted love might be unfortunate enough to send May <BRK> into one of her episodes , <BRK> but she was intent on my pancake . <BRK> It struck me for the first time how odd it was that none of them were married . <BRK> Three unmarried sisters living together like this . <BRK> I heard Rosaleen make a sound like Hmmmph , <BRK> and I knew she was thinking about her own sorry husband , <BRK> wishing he hadn't shown up for their ceremony . <BRK> June swore off men <BRK> and said she would never get married , <BRK> and then she met Neil when he came to be the new principal at her school . <BRK> I don't know what happened to his wife , <BRK> but he didn't have one anymore after he moved here . <BRK> He has tried every which way to get June to marry him , <BRK> but she won't do it . <BRK> Me and August can't convince her either . <BRK> A wheeze welled up from May's chest , <BRK> and then out came Oh ! Susanna . <BRK> Here we go . <BRK> Lord , not again , <BRK> said Rosaleen . <BRK> I'm sorry , <BRK> May said . <BRK> I just can't help it . <BRK> Why don't you go out to the wall ? I said , <BRK> prying the spatula out of her hand . <BRK> It's okay . <BRK> Yeah , <BRK> Rosaleen told her . <BRK> You do what you gotta do . <BRK> We watched from the screen door as May cut past June and Neil . <BRK> A few minutes later June came in with Neil behind her . <BRK> I worried that his head wouldn't clear the door . <BRK> What started May off ? <BRK> June wanted to know . <BRK> Her eyes followed a roach that darted beneath the refrigerator . <BRK> You didn't step on a roach in front of her , did you ? <BRK> No , <BRK> I said . <BRK> We didn't even see a roach . <BRK> She opened the cabinet under the sink and dug into the back for a pump can of bug killer . <BRK> I thought about explaining to her my mother's ingenious method of ridding the house of roaches <BRK> cracker crumbs and marshmallow <BRK> but then I thought , <BRK> This is June , <BRK> forget it . <BRK> Well , what upset her , then ? <BRK> June asked . <BRK> I hated to come out and say it with Neil standing right there , <BRK> but Rosaleen didn't have any problem with it . <BRK> She's upset you won't marry Neil . <BRK> I had never considered until then <BRK> that colored people could blush , <BRK> or maybe it was anger that turned June's face and ears such a dark plum color . <BRK> Neil laughed . <BRK> See there . You should marry me and quit upsetting your sister . <BRK> Oh , get out of here , <BRK> she said , <BRK> and gave him a push . <BRK> You promised me pancakes , <BRK> and I'm gonna have them , <BRK> he said . <BRK> He wore blue jeans and an undershirt with grease smears on it , <BRK> along with horn rimmed glasses . <BRK> He looked like a very studious mechanic . <BRK> He smiled at me and then Rosaleen . <BRK> So are you gonna introduce me or keep me in the dark ? <BRK> I have noticed that if you look carefully at people's eyes the first five seconds they look at you , <BRK> the truth of their feelings will shine through for just an instant before it flickers away . <BRK> June's eyes turned dull and hard when she looked at me . <BRK> This is Lily and Rosaleen , <BRK> she said . <BRK> They're visiting for a while . <BRK> Where do you come from ? <BRK> he asked me . <BRK> This is the number one most asked question in all of South Carolina . <BRK> We want to know <BRK> if you are one of us , <BRK> if your cousin knows our cousin , <BRK> if your little sister went to school with our big brother , if you go to the same Baptist church as our ex boss . <BRK> We are looking for ways our stories fit together . <BRK> It was rare , though , for Negroes to ask white people where they're from , <BRK> because there was nothing much to be gained from it , as their stories weren't that likely to link up . <BRK> Spartanburg County , <BRK> I said , <BRK> having to pause and remember what I'd said earlier . <BRK> And you ? <BRK> he said to Rosaleen . <BRK> She stared at the copper Jell O molds that hung on either side of the window over the sink . <BRK> Same place as Lily . <BRK> What's that burning ? <BRK> said June . <BRK> Smoke poured off the griddle . <BRK> The L shaped pancake had burned to a crisp . <BRK> June yanked the spatula from my fingers , scraped up the mess , and dropped it into the trash . <BRK> How long are you planning on staying ? <BRK> Neil asked . <BRK> June stared at me . <BRK> Waiting . <BRK> Her lips pinched <BRK> tight along her teeth . <BRK> A while longer , I answered , <BRK> looking over into the garbage can . <BRK> L for Lily . <BRK> I could feel the questions gathering in him , <BRK> knew I could <BRK> not face them . I'm not hungry , <BRK> I said , <BRK> and walked out the back door . <BRK> Crossing the back porch , I heard Rosaleen say to him , <BRK> Have you registered yourself to vote ? <BRK> On Sunday I thought they would go to church , <BRK> but no , they held a special service in the pink house , <BRK> and people came to them . <BRK> It was a group called the Daughters of Mary , <BRK> which August had organized . <BRK> The Daughters of Mary started showing up in the parlor before 10 00 A . M . <BRK> First was an old woman named Queenie <BRK> and her grown daughter , Violet . <BRK> They were dressed alike in bright yellow skirts and white blouses , <BRK> though they wore different hats , at least . <BRK> Next came Lunelle , <BRK> Mabelee , and Cressie , <BRK> who wore the fanciest hats I'd ever laid eyes on . <BRK> It turned out Lunelle was a hatmaker without the least bit of shyness . <BRK> I'm talking about purple felt the size of a sombrero with fake fruit <BRK> on the back . <BRK> That was Lunelle's . <BRK> Mabelee wore a creation of tiger fur <BRK> wrapped with gold fringe , <BRK> but it was Cressie who carried the day <BRK> in a crimson smokestack with black netting and ostrich feathers . <BRK> If this was not enough , <BRK> they wore clip on earbobs of various colored rhinestones and circles of rouge <BRK> on their brown cheeks . <BRK> I thought they were beautiful . <BRK> In addition to all these Daughters , <BRK> it turned out Mary had one son besides Jesus , a man named Otis Hill , <BRK> with stubby teeth , <BRK> in an oversize navy suit , <BRK> so technically the group was the Daughters and Son of Mary . <BRK> He'd come with his wife , <BRK> who was known to everyone as Sugar Girl . <BRK> She wore a white dress , <BRK> turquoise cotton gloves , <BRK> and an emerald green turban on her head . <BRK> August and June , <BRK> hatless , gloveless , earbobless , <BRK> looked practically poverty stricken next to them , <BRK> but May , good old May , <BRK> had tied on a bright blue hat with the brim up on one side and down on the other . <BRK> August had brought in chairs and arranged them in a semicircle facing the wooden statue <BRK> of Mary . <BRK> When we were all seated , <BRK> she lit the candle and June played the cello . <BRK> We said the Hail Marys together , <BRK> Queenie and Violet moving strings of wooden beads through their fingers . <BRK> August stood up <BRK> and said she was glad me and Rosaleen were with them ; <BRK> then she opened a Bible and read , <BRK> And Mary said Behold , <BRK> from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed . <BRK> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things . <BRK> He hath scattered the proud . <BRK> He hath put down the mighty from their seats , <BRK> and exalted them of low degree . <BRK> He hath filled the hungry with good things ; <BRK> and the rich he hath sent <BRK> empty away . <BRK> Laying the Bible in her chair , <BRK> she said , <BRK> It's been a while since we've told the story of Our Lady of Chains , <BRK> and since we have visitors who've never heard the story of our statue , <BRK> I thought we'd tell it again . <BRK> One thing I <BRK> was starting to understand was that August loved to tell a good story . <BRK> Really , <BRK> it's good for all of us to hear it again , <BRK> she said . <BRK> Stories have to be told or they die , <BRK> and when they die , <BRK> we can't remember who we are or why we're here . <BRK> Cressie nodded , <BRK> making the ostrich feathers wave through the air so you had the impression of a real <BRK> bird in the room . <BRK> That's right . <BRK> Tell the story , <BRK> she said . <BRK> August pulled her chair close to the statue of black Mary and sat facing us . <BRK> When she began , <BRK> it didn't sound like August talking at all <BRK> but like somebody talking through her , <BRK> someone from another time and place . <BRK> All the while <BRK> her eyes looked off toward the window , <BRK> like she was seeing the drama play out in the sky . <BRK> Well , <BRK> she said , <BRK> back in the time of slaves , <BRK> when the  people were beaten down <BRK> and kept like property , <BRK> they prayed every day and every night for deliverance . <BRK> On the islands near Charleston , they would go to the praise house and sing and pray , and every single time <BRK> someone would ask the Lord to send them rescue . To send them consolation . <BRK> To send them freedom . <BRK> I could tell she had repeated those opening lines a thousand times , <BRK> that she was saying them the exact way she'd heard them coming from the lips of some old woman , <BRK> who'd heard them from <BRK> the lips of an even older one , the way they came out like a song , <BRK> with rhythms that rocked us to and fro till <BRK> we had left the premises and were , <BRK> ourselves , on the islands of Charleston looking for rescue . <BRK> One day , <BRK> August said , <BRK> a slave named Obadiah was loading bricks onto a boat that would sail down the Ashley River , <BRK> when he saw something <BRK> washed up on the bank . <BRK> Coming closer , <BRK> he saw it was the wooden figure of a woman . <BRK> Her body was growing out of a block of wood , a black woman with her arm <BRK> lifted out and her fist balled up . <BRK> At this point August stood up and struck the pose herself . <BRK> She looked just like the statue standing there , <BRK> her right arm raised and her hand clutched into a fist . <BRK> She stayed like that for a few seconds while we sat , <BRK> spellbound . <BRK> Obadiah pulled the figure out of the water , <BRK> she went on , <BRK> and struggled to set her upright . <BRK> Then he remembered how they'd asked the Lord to send them rescue . To send them consolation . To send them freedom . <BRK> Obadiah knew the Lord had sent this figure , but he didn't know who she was . <BRK>  He knelt down in the marsh mud before her and heard her voice speak <BRK> plain as day in his heart . <BRK> She said , <BRK> 'It's all right . <BRK> I'm here . <BRK> I'll be taking care of you now . <BRK> ' This story was ten times better than Beatrix the nun . <BRK> August glided back and forth across the room as she spoke . <BRK> Obadiah tried to pick up the waterlogged woman <BRK> who God had sent to take care of them , <BRK> but she was too heavy , <BRK> so he went and got two more slaves , and between them they carried her to the praise house and set her on the hearth . <BRK> By the time the next Sunday came , everyone had heard about the statue washing up from the river , how it had spoken to Obadiah . <BRK> The praise house was filled with people spilling out the door <BRK> and sitting on the window ledges . Obadiah told <BRK> them he knew the Lord God had sent her , <BRK> but he didn't know who she was . <BRK> He didn't know who she was ! <BRK> cried Sugar Girl , <BRK> breaking in to the story . <BRK> Then all the Daughters of Mary broke loose , <BRK> saying over and over , Not one of them knew . <BRK> I looked over at Rosaleen , <BRK> who I hardly recognized for the way she leaned forward in her chair , <BRK> chanting along with them . <BRK> When everything had quieted down , <BRK> August said , <BRK> Now , <BRK> the oldest of the slaves was a woman named Pearl . <BRK> She walked with a stick , <BRK> and when she spoke , everyone listened . <BRK> She got to her feet and said , <BRK> 'This here is the mother of Jesus . <BRK> ' Everyone knew the mother of Jesus was named Mary , <BRK> and that she'd seen suffering of every kind . That she was strong and constant and had a mother's heart . <BRK> And here she was , <BRK> sent to them on the same waters that had brought them here in chains . <BRK> It seemed to them she knew everything they suffered . <BRK> I stared at the statue , <BRK> feeling the fractured place in my heart . <BRK> And so , <BRK> August said , <BRK> the people cried and danced and clapped their hands . <BRK> They went one at a time and touched their hands to her chest , wanting to grab <BRK> on to the solace in her heart . <BRK> They did this every Sunday in the praise house , <BRK> dancing and touching her chest , and eventually they painted a red heart on her breast <BRK> so the people would have a heart to touch . <BRK> Our Lady filled their hearts with fearlessness and whispered to <BRK> them plans of escape . <BRK> The bold ones fled , finding their way north , <BRK> and those who didn't lived with a raised fist in their hearts . <BRK> And if ever it grew weak , <BRK> they would only have to touch her heart again . <BRK> She grew so powerful she became known even to the master . <BRK> One day he hauled her off on a wagon and chained her in the carriage house . But then , <BRK> without any human help , <BRK> she escaped during the night and made her way back to the praise house . <BRK> The master chained her in <BRK> the barn fifty times , and fifty times she loosed the chains and went home . <BRK> Finally he gave up <BRK> and let her stay there . <BRK> The room grew quiet as August stood there a minute , <BRK> letting everything sink in . When <BRK> she spoke again , she raised her arms out beside her . <BRK> The people called her <BRK> Our Lady of Chains . <BRK> They called her that not because she wore chains <BRK> Not because she wore chains , <BRK> the Daughters chanted . <BRK> They called her Our Lady of Chains because <BRK> she broke them . <BRK> June wedged the cello between her legs <BRK> and played Amazing Grace , <BRK> and the Daughters of Mary got to their feet <BRK> and swayed together like colorful seaweed on the ocean floor . <BRK> I thought this was the grand finale , <BRK> but no , <BRK> June switched over to the piano and banged out a jazzed up version of Go Tell <BRK> It on the Mountain . <BRK> That's when August started a conga line . <BRK> She danced over to Lunelle , <BRK> who latched on to August's waist . <BRK> Cressie hooked on to Lunelle , followed by Mabelee , and off they went around the room <BRK> , causing Cressie to grab hold of her crimson hat . <BRK> When they swung back by , <BRK> Queenie and Violet joined them , then Sugar Girl . <BRK> I wanted to be part of it , too , <BRK> but I only watched , <BRK> and so did Rosaleen and Otis . <BRK> June seemed to play faster and faster . <BRK> I fanned my face , trying to get a little air , <BRK> feeling light headed . <BRK> When the dance ended , the Daughters stood panting in a half circle before Our Lady of Chains , <BRK> and what they did next <BRK> took my breath away . <BRK> One at a time they went and touched the statue's fading red heart . <BRK> Queenie and her daughter went together and rubbed their palms against the wood . <BRK> Lunelle pressed her fingers to Mary's heart , <BRK> then kissed each one of them in a slow , deliberate way , <BRK> a way that brought tears to my eyes . <BRK> Otis pressed his forehead to the heart , <BRK> standing there the longest time of them all , <BRK> head to heart , <BRK> like he was filling up his empty tank . <BRK> June kept playing while each of them came , <BRK> until there was only Rosaleen and me left . <BRK> May nodded to June to keep on with the music <BRK> and took Rosaleen's hand , <BRK> pulling her to Our Lady of Chains , <BRK> so even Rosaleen got to touch Mary's heart . <BRK> I wanted to touch her vanishing red heart , too , <BRK> as much as anything I'd ever wanted . <BRK> As I rose from my chair , my head was still swimming some . <BRK> I walked toward black Mary with my hand lifted . <BRK> But just as I was about to reach her , <BRK> June stopped playing . <BRK> She stopped right in the middle of the song , <BRK> and I was left in the silence with my hand stretched out . <BRK> Drawing it back , <BRK> I looked around me , and it was like seeing everything through a train's thick window . <BRK> A blur passed before me . <BRK> A moving wave of color . <BRK> I am not one of you , <BRK> I thought . <BRK> My body felt numb . <BRK> I thought how nice it would be to grow smaller and smaller <BRK> until I was a dot of nothing . I heard August scolding , <BRK> June , <BRK> what got into you ? <BRK> but her voice was so distant . <BRK> I called to the Lady of Chains , <BRK> but maybe I wasn't really saying her name out loud , only hearing myself call on the inside . <BRK> That's the last I remember . <BRK> Her name echoing through the empty spaces . <BRK> When I woke , I was lying on August's bed across the hall with an ice cold washcloth folded over my forehead <BRK> and August and Rosaleen staring down at me . <BRK> Rosaleen had pulled up the skirt of her dress and was fanning me with it , <BRK> showing most of her thighs . <BRK> Since when have you started fainting ? <BRK> she said , <BRK> and sat down on the edge of the bed , <BRK> causing me to roll into her side . <BRK> She scooped me into her arms . <BRK> For some reason <BRK> this caused my chest to fill with more sadness than I could bear , <BRK> and I wrestled myself free , <BRK> claiming I needed a drink of water . <BRK> Maybe it was the heat , <BRK> August said . <BRK> I should've turned on the fans . It must've been ninety degrees in there . <BRK> I'm all right , <BRK> I told them , <BRK> but to tell the truth , <BRK> I was bewildered at myself . <BRK> I felt I'd stumbled upon an amazing secret it was possible to close your eyes <BRK> and exit life without actually dying . <BRK> You just had to faint . <BRK> Only I didn't know <BRK> how to make it happen , how to pull the plug so I could drain away when I needed to . <BRK> My fainting spell had broken up the Daughters of Mary and sent May to the wailing wall . <BRK> June had gone upstairs to her room and locked the door , <BRK> while the Daughters huddled in the kitchen . <BRK> We chalked it up to heat . <BRK> Heat , <BRK> we said . <BRK> Heat would make a person do strange things . <BRK> You should have seen how August and Rosaleen fussed over me the rest of the evening . <BRK> You want some root beer , Lily ? <BRK> How about a feather pillow ? <BRK> Here , swallow this spoon of honey . <BRK> We sat in the den , <BRK> where I ate supper off a tray , <BRK> which was a privilege in itself . <BRK> June was still in her room , not answering August's calls at the door , <BRK> and May , who wasn't allowed near the TV because she'd already spent way too much time today <BRK> at the wall , <BRK> was in the kitchen clipping recipes from McCall's magazine . <BRK> On the television Mr . Cronkite said they were going to send a rocket ship to the moon . <BRK> On July twenty eighth , <BRK> the United States of America will launch Ranger Seven from Cape Kennedy , Florida , <BRK> he said . <BRK> It was going to take a 253 , <BRK> 665 mile flight before <BRK> it crash landed onto the moon . <BRK> The whole point was to take pictures of the surface and send them back . <BRK> Well , baby Jesus , <BRK> said Rosaleen . <BRK> A rocket to the moon . <BRK> August shook her head . <BRK> Next they'll be walking around up there . <BRK> We had all thought President Kennedy was off his rocker when he declared we'd land a man on <BRK> the moon . <BRK> The Sylvan newspaper had called it a Luna tic Vision . <BRK> I took the article to class for the current events bulletin board . <BRK> We all said , <BRK> A man on the moon . <BRK> Right . <BRK> But you can never underestimate the power of cutthroat competition . <BRK> We wanted to beat the Russians <BRK> that was what made the world go around for us . <BRK> Now it looked like we would . <BRK> August cut off the TV set . <BRK> I need some air . <BRK> We all went , <BRK> Rosaleen and August holding on to my elbows in case I started to keel over again . <BRK> It was the in between time , <BRK> before day leaves and <BRK> night comes , <BRK> a time I've never been partial to because of the sadness that lingers in the space between <BRK> going and coming . <BRK> August gazed at the sky where the moon was rising , <BRK> large and ghostly silver . <BRK> Look at her good , Lily , <BRK> she said , <BRK> 'cause you're seeing the end of something . <BRK> I am ? <BRK> Yes , you are , <BRK> because as long as people have been on this earth , <BRK> the moon has been a mystery to us . <BRK> Think about it . <BRK> She is strong enough to pull the oceans , <BRK> and when  she dies away , she always comes back again . My mama used to tell me Our Lady lived on the moon <BRK> and that I should dance when her face was bright <BRK> and hibernate <BRK> when it was dark . August stared at the sky a long moment <BRK> and then , turning toward the house , said , <BRK> Now it won't ever be the same , <BRK> not after they've landed up there and walked around on her . <BRK> She'll be just one more big science project . <BRK> I thought about the dream I'd had that night Rosaleen and I slept by the pond , <BRK> how the moon had cracked to pieces . <BRK> August disappeared into the house , <BRK> and Rosaleen headed for her cot in the honey house , <BRK> but I stayed on and stared at the sky , <BRK> imagining Ranger 7 blasting away for it . <BRK> I knew one day <BRK> I would go back into the parlor when no one was around <BRK> and touch the Lady's heart . <BRK> Then I would show August the picture of my mother <BRK> and see if the moon broke loose <BRK> and fell out of the sky . <BRK> How did bees ever become equated with sex ? <BRK> They do not live a riotous sex life themselves . <BRK> A hive suggests cloister more than bordello . <BRK> I jumped every time I heard a siren . <BRK> It might have been an ambulance off in the distance <BRK> or a police chase on television <BRK> it didn't matter . <BRK> Part of me was always braced for T . Ray or Mr . Shoe Gaston to drive up and end my charmed life . <BRK> We had been at August's house eight whole days . <BRK> I didn't know how long black Mary could keep the curtain drawn . <BRK> On Monday morning , July 13 , <BRK> I was walking back to the honey house after breakfast <BRK> when I noticed a strange black Ford parked in the driveway . <BRK> I lost my breath for a moment , <BRK> till I remembered Zach was coming back to work today . <BRK> It would be me <BRK> and August and Zach . <BRK> I'm not proud of it , <BRK> but I resented the intrusion . <BRK> He was not what <BRK> I expected . I found him inside holding a honey drizzle like a microphone , <BRK> singing , <BRK> I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill . I watched unseen from the doorway , <BRK> not making a sound , <BRK> but when he launched into Viva Las Vegas , <BRK> slinging his hips around Elvis style , I broke out laughing . <BRK> He whirled around , <BRK> knocking over <BRK> a tray of brood frames , which made a great big mess all over the floor . <BRK> I was just singing , <BRK> he said , like this was news to me . <BRK> Who are you anyway ? Lily , I said . <BRK> I'm staying <BRK> with August and them for a while . <BRK> I'm Zachary Taylor , <BRK> he said . <BRK> Zachary Taylor was a president , <BRK> I told him . <BRK> Yeah , <BRK> so I've heard . <BRK> He fished out a dogtag suspended on a chain under his shirt <BRK> and held it up to my nose . <BRK> See right there . <BRK> Zachary Lincoln Taylor . <BRK> He smiled then , <BRK> and I saw he had a one side dimple . <BRK> It's a feature that has always gotten to me . <BRK> He went and got a towel and cleaned up the floor . <BRK> August told me about you being here and helping us out , <BRK> but she didn't say anything about you being . . . <BRK> white . <BRK> Yep , <BRK> I'm white , all right , <BRK> I said . <BRK> White as can be . <BRK> There was nothing white about Zachary Lincoln Taylor . <BRK> Even the whites of his eyes <BRK> weren't exactly white . <BRK> He had broad shoulders <BRK> and a narrow waist and short cropped hair like most of the Negro boys wore , <BRK> but it was his face I couldn't help staring at . <BRK> If he was shocked over me being white , <BRK> I was shocked over him being handsome . <BRK> At my school they made fun of colored people's lips and noses . <BRK> I myself had laughed at these jokes , <BRK> hoping to fit in . <BRK> Now I wished I could pen a letter to my school to be read at opening assembly <BRK> that would tell them how wrong we'd all been . <BRK> You should see Zachary Taylor , <BRK> I'd say . <BRK> I wondered how August could forget to tell him a thing like the fact that I was white . <BRK> She'd told me plenty about him . <BRK> I knew she was his godmother . <BRK> That his daddy had left him when he was small , <BRK> that his mama worked as a lunchroom lady at the same school where June taught . <BRK> He was about to be a junior at the black high school , <BRK> where he made all A's and played halfback on the football team . <BRK> She'd said he ran like the wind , <BRK> which might be his ticket to a college up north . <BRK> This had struck me as better than I would manage , <BRK> since I was probably headed for beauty school now . I said , <BRK> August went out to the Satterfield farm to check on some hives . <BRK> She said I should help you in here . <BRK> What do you want me to do ? <BRK> Grab some <BRK> frames from the hive boxes over there and help me load the uncapper , I guess . <BRK> So who do you like best , <BRK> Fats Domino or Elvis ? <BRK> I asked , dropping in the first frame . <BRK> Miles Davis , <BRK> he said . <BRK> I don't know who that is . <BRK> Of course you don't . <BRK> But he's the best trumpet player in the world . <BRK> I'd give anything to play like him . <BRK> Would you give up football ? <BRK> How do you know <BRK> I play football ? <BRK> I know things , I said , <BRK> and smiled at him . <BRK> I can see that . <BRK> He was trying not to smile back . <BRK> I thought , <BRK> We're going to be friends . <BRK> He flipped the switch , and the extractor started to spin , building speed . <BRK> So how come you're staying here ? <BRK> Me and Rosaleen are on our way to Virginia to live with my aunt . <BRK> My daddy died in a tractor accident , <BRK> and I haven't had a mother since I was little , <BRK> so I'm trying to get to my family up there before I get put in an orphanage or something . <BRK> But how come you're here ? <BRK> Oh , <BRK> you mean at August's . <BRK> We were hitchhiking and got let out at Tiburon . We knocked on August's door , and she gave us a bed . That's it . <BRK> He nodded like this made some kind of actual sense . <BRK> How long have you worked here ? <BRK> I asked , <BRK> happy to change the subject . <BRK> All through high school . <BRK> I come after school when it's not football season , <BRK> every Saturday and all summer . <BRK> I bought a car with the money I made last year . <BRK> That Ford out there ? <BRK> Yeah , <BRK> it's a '59 Ford Fairlane , <BRK> he said . <BRK> He flipped the switch on the extractor again , <BRK> and the machine groaned while it came to a stop . <BRK> Come on , <BRK> I'll show you . <BRK> I could see my face in the surface of it . <BRK> I figured he stayed up nights polishing it with his undershirts . <BRK> I walked along giving it the white glove inspection . <BRK> You can teach me to drive , <BRK> I said . <BRK> Not in this car . <BRK> Why not ? <BRK> Because you look like the kind of girl who'll wreck something for sure . <BRK> I turned to face him , <BRK> ready to defend myself , <BRK> and saw he was grinning . <BRK> And there was the one side dimple again . <BRK> For sure , <BRK> he said . <BRK> Wreck something for sure . <BRK> Every day Zach and I worked in the honey house . <BRK> August and Zach had already extracted most of the honey from her bee yards , <BRK> but there were still several stacks of supers on pallets sitting around . <BRK> We ran the warmer and caught the wax in a tin tub , <BRK> then loaded the frames into the extractor and filtered the honey through brand new nylon hose . <BRK> August liked to keep a little pollen in her honey because <BRK> it was good for people , <BRK> so we saw to that , too . <BRK> Sometimes we broke off pieces of comb and pushed <BRK> them down into the jars before we filled them . <BRK> You had to make sure they were new combs with <BRK> no brood eggs in them , <BRK> since nobody wanted to have baby bee larvae in their honey . <BRK> And if we weren't doing all that , <BRK> we were filling candle molds with beeswax and washing mason jars till my hands turned <BRK> stiff as corn husk from detergent . <BRK> The only part of the day I dreaded was dinner , <BRK> when I had to be around June . <BRK> You'd think anybody who played music for dying people would be a nicer person . <BRK> I couldn't understand why she resented me so much . <BRK> Somehow even me being white <BRK> and imposing on their hospitality didn't seem enough reason . <BRK> How are things coming with you , Lily ? <BRK> she'd say every night at the table . <BRK> Like she'd rehearsed this in the mirror . <BRK> I'd say , <BRK> Things are coming fine . <BRK> And how are they coming with you , June ? <BRK> She would glance at August , <BRK> who would be following all this like she was overcome with interest . <BRK> Fine , <BRK> June would say . <BRK> Having gotten that out of the way , <BRK> we would shake out our napkins and do our best to ignore each other the rest of the meal . <BRK> I knew that August was trying to correct June's rudeness toward me , <BRK> but I wanted to say to her , <BRK> Do you think me and June Boatwright give a damn how each other is coming ? <BRK> Just give up . <BRK> One night after the Hail Marys , <BRK> August said , <BRK> Lily , <BRK> if you wish to touch Our Lady's heart , <BRK> you're welcome , <BRK> isn't she , June ? <BRK> I glanced at June , who gave me a forced smile . <BRK> Maybe some other time , <BRK> I said . <BRK> I'm here to tell you , <BRK> if I was dying on my cot in the honey house <BRK> and the only thing that could save me was June's change of heart , <BRK> I would meet my death and shoot straight to heaven . <BRK> Or maybe hell . <BRK> I wasn't even sure anymore . <BRK> The best meal was lunch , <BRK> which Zach and I ate under the cool of the pine trees . <BRK> May fixed us bologna sandwiches nearly every single day . <BRK> We could also count on candlestick salad , <BRK> which meant half a banana standing up in a pineapple slice . <BRK> Let me light your candle , <BRK> she'd say , <BRK> and strike an imaginary match . <BRK> Then she'd fasten a bottled cherry on the tip of the banana with a toothpick . <BRK> Like Zach and I were still in kindergarten . <BRK> But we'd <BRK> go along with her , acting all excited over her lighting the banana . <BRK> For dessert we crunched cubes of lime Kool Aid , <BRK> which she'd frozen in ice trays . <BRK> One day we sat on the grass after lunch , <BRK> listening to the wind snap the sheets Rosaleen had hung on the clothesline . <BRK> What's your favorite subject in school ? <BRK> Zach asked . <BRK> English . <BRK> I bet you like to write themes , <BRK> he said , <BRK> rolling his eyes . <BRK> As a matter of fact <BRK> I do . I was planning on being a writer and an English teacher in my spare time . <BRK> Was planning ? <BRK> he said . <BRK> I don't think I have much of a future now , <BRK> being an orphan . <BRK> What I meant was being a fugitive from the law . <BRK> Considering the state of things , <BRK> I didn't know if I'd even get back to high school . <BRK> He studied his fingers . <BRK> I could smell the sharp scent of his sweat . <BRK> He had patches of honey on his shirt , <BRK> which were attracting a horde of flies <BRK> and causing him to swat incessantly . <BRK> After a while he said , <BRK> Me either . <BRK> You either what ? <BRK> I don't know if I'll have much of a future either . <BRK> Why not ? <BRK> You're not an orphan . <BRK> No , <BRK> he said . <BRK> I'm a Negro . <BRK> I felt embarrassed . <BRK> Well , you could play football for a college team and then be a professional player . <BRK> Why is it sports is the only thing white people see us being successful at ? <BRK> I don't want to play football , <BRK> he said . <BRK> I wanna be a lawyer . <BRK> That's fine with me , <BRK> I said , a little annoyed . <BRK> I've just never heard of a Negro lawyer , that's all . <BRK> You've got to hear of these things before you can imagine them . <BRK> Bullshit . <BRK> You gotta imagine what's never been . <BRK> I closed my eyes . <BRK> All right then , <BRK> I'm imagining a Negro lawyer . <BRK> You are a Negro Perry Mason . <BRK> People are coming to you from all over the state , <BRK> wrong accused people , <BRK> and you <BRK> get at the truth at the very last minute by tricking the real criminal on the witness stand . <BRK> Yeah , <BRK> he said , <BRK> I bust their ass with the truth . <BRK> When he laughed , <BRK> his tongue was grass green from Kool Aid . <BRK> I started calling him Zach the ass busting lawyer . <BRK> Oh , look who's here , Zach the ass busting lawyer , <BRK> I'd say . <BRK> It was along about this point Rosaleen started asking me what did I think I was doing <BRK> auditioning myself to get adopted by the calendar sisters ? <BRK> She said I was living in a dream world . <BRK> Dream world became her favorite two words . <BRK> It was living in a dream world to pretend we had a regular life when there was a manhunt <BRK> going on , <BRK> to think we could stay here forever , <BRK> to believe I would find out anything worth knowing about my mother . <BRK> Every time I shot back , <BRK> What's wrong with living in a dream world ? <BRK> And she'd say , <BRK> You have to wake up . <BRK> One afternoon when I was alone in the honey house , <BRK> June wandered in looking for August . <BRK> Or so she said . <BRK> She crossed her arms over her chest . <BRK> So , <BRK> she said , <BRK> you've been here what ? Two weeks now ? <BRK> How obvious can you get ? <BRK> Look , if you want us to leave , <BRK> me and Rosaleen will be on our way , I said . <BRK> I'll write my aunt , and she'll send us bus money . <BRK> She raised her eyebrows . <BRK> I thought you didn't remember your aunt's last name , <BRK> and now you know her name and her address . <BRK> Actually , <BRK> I knew it all along , <BRK> I said . I was just hoping for a little time before we had to leave . <BRK> It seemed like her face softened some when I said that , <BRK> but it could've been wishful thinking on my part . <BRK> Heavens to Betsy , what's this talk about you leaving ? <BRK> said August , <BRK> standing in the doorway . <BRK> Neither one of us had seen her come in . <BRK> She gave June a hard look . <BRK> Nobody wants you to leave , Lily , <BRK> till you're good and ready . <BRK> Standing beside August's desk <BRK> , <BRK> I fidgeted with a stack of papers . <BRK> June cleared her throat . <BRK> Well , <BRK> I need to get back and practice , <BRK> she said , <BRK> and breezed out the door . <BRK> August walked over and sat down in her desk chair . <BRK> Lily , <BRK> you can talk to me . <BRK> You know that , don't you ? <BRK> When I didn't answer , <BRK> she caught my hand and drew me to her , <BRK> pulling me right down onto her lap . <BRK> It was not mattress deep like Rosaleen's <BRK> but thin and angular . <BRK> I wanted nothing more than to come clean with her . <BRK> Go pull my bag from underneath the cot and bring out my mother's things . <BRK> I wanted to produce the black Mary picture and say , <BRK> This belonged to my mother , <BRK> this exact same , identical picture you put on your honey jars . <BRK> And it has Tiburon , South Carolina , written on the back , so I know she must've been here . <BRK> I wanted to hold up her photograph and say , <BRK> Have you ever seen her ? <BRK> Take your time now . <BRK> Think carefully . <BRK> But <BRK> I hadn't yet pressed my hand to the black Mary's heart in the parlor , <BRK> and I was too afraid to say all this without having done at least that . I leaned against August's chest , <BRK> pushing aside my secret wanting , <BRK> too afraid she'd say , <BRK> No , <BRK> I never saw this woman in my life . <BRK> And that would be that . <BRK> Not knowing anything at all was better . <BRK> I struggled to my feet . <BRK> I guess I'll go help in the kitchen . <BRK> I crossed the yard without a glance back . <BRK> That night , <BRK> when the darkness was weighed down with singing crickets <BRK> and Rosaleen was snoring right along with them , <BRK> I had myself a good cry . <BRK> I couldn't even say why . <BRK> Just everything , I guess . <BRK> Because I hated lying to August when she was so good to me . <BRK> Because Rosaleen was probably right about dream worlds . <BRK> Because I was pretty sure the Virgin Mary was not back there on the peach farm standing in <BRK> for me the way she'd stood in for Beatrix . <BRK> Neil came over most evenings <BRK> and sat with June in <BRK> the parlor while the rest of us watched The Fugitive on television in the den . <BRK> August said she wished the fugitive would go ahead and find the one armed man and get it over with . <BRK> During commercials I pretended to go for water <BRK> and instead crept down the hall , <BRK> where I tried to make out what June and Neil were saying . Chapter Nine <BRK> July 28 was a day for the record books . <BRK> I look back on it <BRK> and what comes to me <BRK> are people going over Niagara Falls in barrels . <BRK> Ever since  I'd heard about that , I'd tried to imagine people crouched inside , <BRK> bobbing along peacefully like a rubber duck in a child's bathtub , <BRK> and suddenly the water turning choppy and the barrel starting to thrash <BRK> around while a roar grows in the distance . <BRK> I knew  they were in there saying , <BRK> Shitbucket , what was I thinking ? <BRK> At eight o'clock in  the morning it hit 94 , <BRK> with the ambitious plan of reaching 103 before noon . <BRK> I woke up with August shaking my shoulder , <BRK> saying it was gonna be a scorcher , <BRK> get up , we had to water the bees . <BRK> I climbed into the honey wagon  with my hair uncombed , <BRK> with May handing me buttered toast <BRK> and orange juice through the window and Rosaleen sticking in thermoses of water , <BRK> both of  them practically running alongside the truck <BRK> while August rolled out of the driveway . <BRK>  I felt like the Red Cross springing  to action to save the bee queendom . <BRK> In the back of the truck <BRK> August had gallons of sugar water already made up . <BRK> When it gets over a hundred , <BRK> she said , <BRK> the flowers dry up and there's no food for the bees . <BRK> They stay in the hives fanning themselves . <BRK> Sometimes they just roast . <BRK> I felt like we might roast alive ourselves . <BRK> You could not touch the door handle for fear of a third degree burn . <BRK> Sweat ran between my breasts and sopped my underwear band . <BRK> August turned on the radio for the weather , <BRK> but what we heard was how Ranger 7 had finally been launched to the moon <BRK> in a place called the Sea of Clouds , <BRK> how police were looking for the bodies of those three civil rights workers in Mississippi , <BRK> and the terrible things happening in Vietnam . <BRK> It ended with a story about what was happening closer to home , <BRK> how black people from Tiburon , Florence , and Orangeburg <BRK> were marching today all the way to Columbia <BRK> asking the governor to enforce the Civil Rights Act . <BRK> August turned it off . <BRK> Enough was enough . <BRK> You cannot fix the whole world . <BRK> I've already watered the hives around the house , <BRK> she said . <BRK> Zach is taking care of the hives on the east side of the county . <BRK> So you and I've got the west side . <BRK> Rescuing bees took us the entire morning . <BRK> Driving back into remote corners of the woods <BRK> where there were barely roads , <BRK> we would come upon twenty five beehives up on slats like a little lost city tucked <BRK> back in there . <BRK> We lifted the covers and filled the feeders with sugar water . <BRK> Earlier we'd spooned dry sugar into our pockets , <BRK> and now , just as a bonus , <BRK> we sprinkled it on the feeding rims . <BRK> I managed to get stung on my wrist while replacing a lid onto a hive box . <BRK> August scraped out the stinger . <BRK> I was sending them love , <BRK> I said , <BRK> feeling betrayed . <BRK> August said , <BRK> Hot weather makes the bees out of sorts , <BRK> I don't care how much love  you send them . <BRK> She pulled a small bottle of olive oil and bee pollen from her free pocket <BRK> and rubbed my skin her patented remedy . <BRK> It was something I'd hoped never to test out . <BRK> Count yourself initiated , <BRK> she said . <BRK> You can't be a true beekeeper without getting stung . <BRK> A true beekeeper . <BRK> The words caused a fullness in me , <BRK> and right at that moment an explosion of blackbirds lifted off the ground in <BRK> a clearing a short distance away <BRK> and filled up the whole sky . <BRK> I said to myself , <BRK> Will wonders never cease ? <BRK> I would add that to my list of careers . <BRK> A writer , <BRK> an English teacher , <BRK> and a beekeeper . <BRK> Do you think <BRK> I could keep bees one day ? I asked . <BRK> August said , <BRK> Didn't you tell me this past week <BRK> one of the things you loved was bees and honey ? <BRK> Now , if that's so , <BRK> you'll be a fine beekeeper . <BRK> Actually , <BRK> you can be bad at something , Lily , <BRK> but if you love doing it , <BRK> that will be enough . <BRK> The sting shot pain all the way to my elbow , <BRK> causing me to marvel at how much punishment a minuscule creature can inflict . <BRK> I'm prideful enough to say I didn't complain . <BRK> After you get stung , <BRK> you can't get unstung no matter how much you whine about it . <BRK> I just dived back into the riptide of saving bees . <BRK> When we had watered all the hives of Tiburon and sprinkled enough sugar to cause a human being to gain fifty pounds , <BRK> we drove home hot , <BRK> hungry , <BRK> and nearly drowned in our own sweat . <BRK> Pulling into the driveway , <BRK> we found Rosaleen and <BRK> May sipping sweet tea on the back porch . May said she'd left our lunches in the refrigerator , <BRK> cold pork chop sandwiches and slaw . <BRK> While we ate , we heard June upstairs in her room playing the cello like something had died . <BRK> We scarfed down every morsel without talking , <BRK> then pushed back from the table . <BRK> We were wondering how to get our tired selves to a standing position <BRK> when we heard squealing and laughing , <BRK> the kind you're apt to hear at a school recess . <BRK> August and I dragged ourselves to the porch to see . <BRK> And there were May and Rosaleen <BRK> running through the water sprinkler , <BRK> barefoot and fully clothed . <BRK> They had gone berserk . <BRK> Rosaleen's muumuu was sopped <BRK> and plastered to her body , <BRK> and May was catching water in the bowl of her dress skirt and tossing it up across her face . <BRK> Sunlight hit the hair sheen on her braids and lit them up . <BRK> Well , <BRK> isn't this the living end ? <BRK> August said . <BRK> When we got out there , <BRK> Rosaleen picked up the sprinkler and aimed it at us . <BRK> You come over here and you gonna get wet , <BRK> she said , <BRK> and splat ! <BRK> we were hit full in the chest with ice cold water . <BRK> Rosaleen turned the sprinkler head down and filled May's dress . <BRK> You come over here and you gonna get wet , <BRK> May said , <BRK> echoing Rosaleen , and she came after us , <BRK> pitching the contents of her skirt across our backs . <BRK> I can tell you this much neither one of us protested that loudly . <BRK> In the end we stood there and let ourselves be drenched by two crazy black women . <BRK> All four of us turned into water nymphs <BRK> and danced around the cool spray , <BRK> just the way it must have been when Indians danced circles around blazing fires . <BRK> Squirrels and Carolina wrens hopped as close as they dared and drank from <BRK> the puddles , <BRK> and you <BRK> could almost see the blades of brown grass lift themselves up <BRK> and turn green . Then the porch door banged , and here came June with her dander up . <BRK> I must have been drunk with water and air and dancing , because I picked up the sprinkler <BRK> and said , <BRK> You come over here and you're gonna get wet . <BRK> Then I hosed her . <BRK> She began to holler . <BRK> Damn it to hell ! <BRK> I knew this was going down the wrong path , <BRK> but I couldn't stop . I was seeing myself as the fire department and June as the raging inferno . <BRK> She yanked the sprinkler out of my hands and turned the spray on me . <BRK> Some of the water rushed up my nose and burned . <BRK> I yanked at the sprinkler , <BRK> and each of us held on to one side of it while it blasted away at our stomachs <BRK> and chins . <BRK> We went to our knees , wrestling for it , <BRK> the geyser weaving between us , <BRK> her eyes <BRK> staring at me , close and bright with beads of water on her eyelashes . <BRK> I heard May start to hum Oh ! Susanna . <BRK> I laughed to let her know it was all right , <BRK> but <BRK> I wouldn't let go . I would not let June Boatwright win . <BRK> Rosaleen said , <BRK> They say if you aim the hose on two locked dogs , <BRK> they'll turn loose , <BRK> but I guess that ain't always so . <BRK> August laughed , <BRK> and I saw the softening come around June's eyes , <BRK> how she was trying not to laugh , <BRK> but it was like <BRK> the Dutch boy pulling his finger out of <BRK> the dike <BRK> the minute she softened her eyes , the whole thing collapsed . I could almost see her smack her forehead , <BRK> thinking , I am wrestling with a fourteen year old girl over a garden sprinkler . <BRK> This is ridiculous . <BRK> She let go and sprawled back on the grass in convulsions of laughter . <BRK> I plopped down next to her <BRK> and laughed , too . <BRK> We could not stop . <BRK> I wasn't exactly sure of everything we were laughing about I was just glad we were doing it together . <BRK> When we got up , <BRK> June said , <BRK> Lord , <BRK> I feel woozy , like somebody has pulled the plugs in my feet and drained me out . <BRK> Rosaleen , <BRK> May , and August <BRK> had returned to the business of being water nymphs . <BRK> I looked back down at <BRK> the ground where our bodies had lain side by side , the wet grasses pressed down , <BRK> perfect depressions in the earth . <BRK> I stepped over them with the utmost care , <BRK> and , seeing how careful I was , <BRK> June stepped over them , too , <BRK> and then , to my shock , <BRK> she hugged me . <BRK> June Boatwright hugged me while <BRK> our clothes made sweet , squishy sounds up and down our bodies . <BRK> If the heat goes over 104 degrees in South Carolina , <BRK> you have to go to bed . <BRK> It is practically the law . <BRK> Some people might see it as shiftless behavior , <BRK> but really , <BRK> when we're lying down from the heat , <BRK> we're giving our minds time to browse around for new ideas , <BRK> wondering at the true aim of life , <BRK> and generally letting things pop into our heads that need to . <BRK> In the sixth grade <BRK> there was a boy in my class who had a steel plate in his skull <BRK> and was always complaining how test answers could never get through to him . <BRK> Our teacher would say , <BRK> Give me  a break . In a way , though , <BRK> the boy was right . <BRK> Every human being on the face of the earth has a steel plate in his head , <BRK> but if you lie down now <BRK> and then and get still as you can , <BRK> it will slide open like elevator doors , <BRK> letting in all the secret thoughts that have been standing around so patiently , <BRK> pushing the button for a ride to the top . <BRK> The real troubles <BRK> in life happen when those hidden doors stay closed for too long . <BRK> But that's just my opinion . <BRK> August , May , June , and Rosaleen were supposedly over in the pink house in their rooms <BRK> lying under the fans with the lights out . <BRK> In the honey house <BRK> I reclined on my cot and told myself I could think about anything I wanted , except my mother , <BRK> so naturally <BRK> she was the only thing that wanted on the elevator . <BRK> I could feel things unraveling around me . <BRK> All the fraying edges of the dream world . <BRK> Pull one wrong thread and I would be standing in wreckage to my elbows . <BRK> Ever since I'd called T . Ray , <BRK> I'd wanted so badly to tell Rosaleen about it . <BRK> To say , <BRK> If you've been wondering whether my leaving has caused T . Ray to examine his heart , <BRK> or change his ways , <BRK> don't waste your time . <BRK> But I couldn't bring myself to admit to her that I'd cared enough to call him . <BRK> What was wrong with me that <BRK> I was living here as if I had nothing to hide ? I lay on the cot and stared at the glaring square of window , <BRK> exhausted . <BRK> It takes so much energy to keep things at bay . <BRK> Let me on , <BRK> my mother was saying . <BRK> Let me on the damn elevator . <BRK> Well , fine . <BRK> I pulled out my bag and examined my mother's picture . <BRK> I wondered what it had been like to be inside her , <BRK> just a curl of flesh swimming in her darkness , <BRK> the quiet things that had passed between us . <BRK> The wanting her was still in me , <BRK> but it wasn't nearly so fierce and raging as before . <BRK> Pulling on her gloves , <BRK> I noticed how tight they fit all of a sudden . <BRK> By the time I was sixteen , <BRK> they would feel like baby gloves on my hands . <BRK> I would be Alice in Wonderland after she ate the cake and grew twice her size . <BRK> My palms would split the seams of the gloves , <BRK> and I would never wear them again . <BRK> I peeled the gloves from my sweaty hands and felt a wave of jitteriness , <BRK> the old saw edged guilt , <BRK> the necklace of lies I could not stop wearing , the fear of being cast out of the pink house . <BRK> No , <BRK> I breathed . <BRK> The word took a long time to work its way to my throat . <BRK> A scared whisper . <BRK> No , I will not think about this . <BRK> I will not <BRK> feel this . <BRK> I will not let this ruin the way things are . <BRK> No . <BRK> I decided that lying down from the heat was a hick idea . <BRK> I gave up and walked to the pink house for something cold to drink . <BRK> If I ever managed to get to heaven after everything I'd done , I hoped I would get just a few minutes for a private conference with God . <BRK> I wanted to say , <BRK> Look , <BRK> I know you meant well creating the world and all , <BRK> but how could you let it get away from you like this ? <BRK> How come you couldn't stick with your original idea of paradise ? <BRK> People's lives were a mess . <BRK> When I came into the kitchen , <BRK> May was sitting on the floor with her legs straight out <BRK> and a box of graham crackers in her lap . <BRK> That would be about right <BRK> me and May the <BRK> only <BRK> two who couldn't lie peaceful on the bed for five minutes . I saw a roach , <BRK> she said , <BRK> reaching into a bag of marshmallows that I hadn't noticed was there . <BRK> She pulled one out and pinched off little pieces of it . <BRK> Crazy May . <BRK> I opened the refrigerator and stood there staring at the contents like I was waiting for the grape juice <BRK> bottle <BRK> to jump in my hand and say , Here , drink me . I could not seem to register what May was doing . <BRK> Sometimes things of magnitude settle over you with excruciating slowness . <BRK> Say you break your ankle <BRK> and don't feel it hurting till you've walked another block . I had nearly finished a glass of juice <BRK> before I let myself look at the little highway of broken graham crackers and marshmallow <BRK> bits that May was constructing across the floor , <BRK> how it started at the sink <BRK> and angled toward the door , <BRK> thick with golden crumbs and smudges of sticky white . <BRK> The roaches will follow this out the door , <BRK> May said . <BRK> It works every time . <BRK> I don't  know how long I stared at the line on the floor , <BRK> at May's face turned toward mine , <BRK> eager for me to say something , <BRK> but I couldn't think what to say . <BRK> The room filled with the steady whir of the refrigerator motor . <BRK> I felt a strange , thick feeling inside . <BRK> A memory . <BRK> I stood there waiting , <BRK> letting it come . <BRK> Your mother was a lunatic when it came to bugs , <BRK> T . Ray had said . <BRK> She used to make trails of graham cracker crumbs and marshmallows to lure roaches outside . <BRK> I looked again at May . <BRK> My mother couldn't have learned the roach trick from May , I thought . <BRK> Could she ? <BRK> Ever since I'd set foot in the pink house , <BRK> some part of me had kept believing that my mother had been here . <BRK> No , not believing it so much as daydreaming it <BRK> and running it through a maze of wishful thinking . <BRK> But now that the actual possibility seemed to be right in front of me , <BRK> it seemed so far fetched , <BRK> crazy . <BRK> It couldn't be , <BRK> I thought again . <BRK> I walked over and sat down at the table . <BRK> Shadows from late afternoon <BRK> pushed into the room . <BRK> They were peach tinted , <BRK> fading in <BRK> and out , and the kitchen was completely silent . <BRK> Even the refrigerator hum had died away . <BRK> May had turned back to her work . <BRK> She seemed oblivious to me sitting there . <BRK> My mother could have learned it from a book , <BRK> maybe from her mother . <BRK> How did <BRK> I know that households everywhere didn't use this particular roach ridding method ? <BRK> I stood up and walked over to May . <BRK> I felt a trembly feeling at the back of my knees . I put my hand on her shoulder . <BRK> Okay , I thought , <BRK> here goes . I said , <BRK> May , <BRK> did you ever know a Deborah ? <BRK> Deborah Fontanel ? A white woman from Virginia ? <BRK> It would have been a long time ago . <BRK> There wasn't a trace of cunning in May , <BRK> and you could depend on her not to overthink her answers . <BRK> She didn't look up , didn't pause , <BRK> just said , <BRK> Oh , yes , <BRK> Deborah Fontanel . <BRK> She stayed out there in the honey house . <BRK> She was the sweetest thing . <BRK> And there it was . <BRK> There it all was . <BRK> For a moment <BRK> I felt light headed . I had to reach for the countertop to steady myself . <BRK> Down on the floor the trail of crumbs and marshmallows looked half alive . <BRK> I had a million more questions , <BRK> but May had started humming Oh ! Susanna . <BRK> She set down the box of crackers and got up slowly , <BRK> starting to sniffle . <BRK> Something about Deborah Fontanel had set her off . <BRK> I think I'll go out to the wall for a little while , <BRK> she said . <BRK> And that's how she left me , <BRK> standing in <BRK> the kitchen , hot and breathless , the world tilted under me . <BRK> Walking to the honey house , <BRK> I concentrated on my feet touching down on the hard caked dirt in the driveway , <BRK> the exposed tree roots , <BRK> fresh watered grass , <BRK> how the earth felt beneath me , <BRK> solid , <BRK> alive , <BRK> ancient , <BRK> right there every time my foot came down . <BRK> There <BRK> and there <BRK> and there , <BRK> always there . <BRK> The things a mother should be . <BRK> Oh , yes , <BRK> Deborah Fontanel . <BRK> She stayed out there in the honey house . <BRK> She was the sweetest thing . <BRK> In the honey house <BRK> I sat on the cot with my knees drawn up , <BRK> hugging them with my arms and making a shelf for the side of my face to rest on . <BRK> I looked at the floor <BRK> and the walls with brand new eyes . My mother had walked about in this room . <BRK> A real person . <BRK> Not somebody I made up but a living , breathing person . <BRK> The last thing I expected was to fall asleep , <BRK> but when there's a blow to the system , <BRK> all the body wants to do is go to sleep and dream on it . <BRK> I woke an hour or so later in the velvety space where you don't yet remember what <BRK> you've dreamed . <BRK> Then suddenly the whole thing washed back to me . <BRK> I am constructing a spiraling trail of honey across a room <BRK> that seems to be in the honey house one minute <BRK> and the next in my bedroom back in Sylvan . <BRK> I start it at a door I've never seen before <BRK> and end it at the foot of my bed . <BRK> Then I sit on the mattress and wait . <BRK> The door opens . <BRK> In walks my mother . <BRK> She follows the honey , <BRK> making twists and turns across the room until she gets to my bed . <BRK> She is smiling , <BRK> so pretty , <BRK> but then I see she is not a normal person . <BRK> She has roach legs protruding through her clothes , <BRK> sticking through the cage of her ribs , down her torso , <BRK> six of them , <BRK> three on each side . <BRK> I couldn't imagine who sat in my head making this stuff up . <BRK> The air was now dusky rose <BRK> and cool enough for a sheet . <BRK> I pulled it around my legs . <BRK> My stomach felt icky , <BRK> like I might throw up . <BRK> If I told you right now that I <BRK> never wondered about that dream , <BRK> never closed my eyes and pictured her <BRK> with roach legs , never wondered why she came to me like that , with her worst nature exposed , <BRK> I would be up to my old habit of lying . <BRK> A roach is a creature no one can love , <BRK> but you cannot kill it . <BRK> It will go on <BRK> and on and on . <BRK> Just try to get rid of it . <BRK> The next few days <BRK> I was a case of nerves .  <BRK> I jumped out of my skin if somebody so much as dropped a nickel on the floor . <BRK> At the dinner table I poked at my food <BRK> and stared into space like I was in a trance . <BRK> Sometimes the picture of my mother with roach legs would leap into my head , and I would have to swallow a spoonful of honey for my stomach . I was so antsy I couldn't sit through five minutes of American Bandstand on television , <BRK> when ordinarily I was glued to Dick Clark's every word . I walked around and around the house , <BRK> pausing here and there to picture my mother in the various rooms . <BRK> Sitting with her skirt spread over the piano bench . <BRK> Kneeling beside Our Lady . <BRK> Studying the recipe collection that May clipped from magazines <BRK> and kept taped on the refrigerator . <BRK> I would stare at these visions with my eyes glazed over , <BRK> only to look up and see August , or June , or Rosaleen watching me . <BRK> They clucked their tongues and felt my face for fever . <BRK> They said , <BRK> What's wrong ? What's got into you ? <BRK> I shook my head . <BRK> Nothing , <BRK> I lied . <BRK> Nothing . <BRK> In truth I felt as if my life was stranded out on the high dive , about to leap <BRK> into unknown waters . <BRK> Dangerous waters . <BRK> I only wanted <BRK> to postpone the plunge awhile , <BRK> to feel my mother's closeness in the house , to pretend I wasn't afraid of the story that had brought her here <BRK> or that she might go and surprise me the way she had in the dream , <BRK> turning up six legged and ugly . <BRK> I wanted to march up to August <BRK> and ask why my mother had been here , <BRK> but fear stopped me . <BRK> I wanted to know , <BRK> and I didn't want to know . <BRK> I was all hung up in limbo . <BRK> Late Friday afternoon , <BRK> after we had finished cleaning the last of the supers and storing them away , <BRK> Zach went out to take a look under the hood of the honey wagon . <BRK> It was still acting funny and overheating , <BRK> in spite of Neil having worked on it . <BRK> I wandered back to my room and sat on my cot . <BRK> Heat radiated from the window . <BRK> I considered getting up to turn on the fan but only sat there staring through the panes at the milky blue sky , <BRK> a sad , <BRK> ragged feeling catching hold inside . <BRK> I could hear music coming from the truck radio , <BRK> Sam Cooke singing Another Saturday Night , <BRK> then May calling across the yard to Rosaleen , <BRK> something about getting the sheets off the clothesline . <BRK> And I was struck all at once <BRK> how life was out there <BRK> going through its regular courses , <BRK> and I was suspended , <BRK> waiting , <BRK> caught in a terrible crevice between living my life <BRK> and not living it . <BRK> I couldn't go on biding time like there was <BRK> no end of it , no end to this summer . <BRK> I felt tears spring up . <BRK> I would have to come clean . <BRK> Whatever happened well , <BRK> it would just happen . <BRK> I went over to the sink <BRK> and washed my face . <BRK> Taking a deep breath , <BRK> I stuffed my mother's black Mary picture <BRK> and her photograph into my pocket and started toward the pink house <BRK> to find August . <BRK> I thought we would sit down on the end of her bed , <BRK> or out in the lawn chairs if the mosquitoes weren't bad . <BRK> I imagined August would say , <BRK> What's on your mind , Lily ? <BRK> Are we finally gonna have our talk ? <BRK> I would pull out the wooden picture <BRK> and tell her every last thing , <BRK> and then she would explain about my mother .
